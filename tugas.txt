Binary-Classification using Logistic Regression

Using the Iris data, pick only 2 classes (Setosa and Versicolour) and two features (you may choose) do the following steps:

1. Load the Iris data from scikit learn and divide the data into two parts: training and test data with ration 80:20. Make sure that the class within each parts of the data is balance. (score: 1)

2. Using scatter plot (matplotlib), visualise the Iris data (training part only) (score: 1)

3. Define a python function for sigmoid function (score:1)

4. Define a python function of the cost function (score:1)

5. Define a python function for the Gradient Descent algorithm (score: 1)

6. Train your Logistic Regression algorithm on the training data, set learning rate: 0.001 and maximum iteration: 100 (score: 1.5)

7. Find thetha(s) that minimize the cost function, and plot the decision boundary using matplotlib. (score: 1)

8. Test your Logistic Regression model on the test data, and calculate the accuracy (create function for accuracy, do not use the function from scikit learn library) (score: 1.5)

9. Plot your cost function using matplotlib (cost function vs iteration) (score: 1)



Note: 

You should submit a python notebook in the format logreg_fullname_yourclass.ipynb (ex: logreg_afiahayati.ipynb)

This assignment will take 10% of the total marks.
